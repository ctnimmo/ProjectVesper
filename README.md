**Using blockchain to capture the essence of digital art**

## Ideas behind Project Vesper

The idea behind Project Vesper: provide a platform for the creation, distribution and validation of genuinely unique digital art.

A philosophy which is often heard about Bitcoin is that its value is partially attributed to its scarcity.

The value of a piece of art, monetarily or emotionally, may also be partially attributed to its scarcity.

Digital art has some difficulty maintaining the attribute of scarcity - one can simply "copy and paste". The idea of a Non Fungible Token (NFT) provides one way to help create a sense of uniquenesss; indeed, recent activities in the world of cryptoart show that the idea has some merit. It is often heard that the value of a thing is "in the eye of the beholder". Holders of art NFTs may enjoy the fact that the art can profilerate and gain public awareness - this raises the value of the NFT for like-minded individuals. Perhaps incoming generations will adopt that mindset especially if integration with the virtual world increases. Also, commercial and legal interests may come into play more and more if NFTs are to be considered as the virtual equivalent of a copyright, maintained via registration on a blockchain.

Whilst the arguments above may hold sway for some (especially where commercial interests are involved), for others, the ownership of digital art via an NFT may not be enough. The bond required to accept originality has a higher threshold for them and needs to tick certain pyschological parameters. In fact, as with NFTs, there are likely variations in accepted thresholds (and time and peer adoption may have an impact). Despite this, could we learn from the lesson of Bitcoin, cryptocurrencies in general and even the NFTs themselves? Is there a way to capture and encapsulate the uniqueness of digital art? Does direct involvement of blockchain technology on art hold any clues? Does the vocabulary of artists and the art world also hold the key to modelling an artist's unique creation in a digital world? 

An aside, let us consider for the moment the concept of mining in the real world and within the bitcoin system.

Real world mining can be a simple act or a full scale industrial operation involving surveyancing, planning, drilling, digging etc. Whatever the steps involved the goal of the endeavour is to spend energy locating and then extracting a resources which then undergoes further purification to produce a thing of value. In fact, we can argue that if something has some inherant value, then the mining process amends that value further (in whatever guise that may be). Metaphorically, a miner has encapsulated time, energy and money within the extrated item to provide a value deviation on the raw untamed resource.

Now the bitcoin mining process is not, on face value, like the real world process. The likeness to real mining though is striking. No actual drills or diggers are used, real machines and electricity are used. Dirt is not dug up and cast aside, but computers sifted through numbers and then cast aside within their program. As for the comparisons to the purification process: when the program on the mining node finds a suitable number (after the sifting process), it send the number to undergo a community level validation process (a consensus mechanism) which, if successful, results in the reward of a bitcoin. Whilst this is by no means a pefect comparison, it does illustrate the point: the term "mining" is used in bitcoin because the underlying models of tangible vs virtual have strong correlations.

This begs the question, what is the true underlying model for a piece of art? Perhaps it is not a single question - as above, one person's "art" is another person's "garbage" - but if we can incorporate more behind ideas from the philosophy, history and psychology then our correlation between virtual art and real world art may begin to narrow.

So back to the idea behind Project Vesper. Its aim is to create a platform for the creation, distribution and validation of genuinely unique digital art. Early iterations may be crude but the goal is to capture the essence of art so that it can truly exist in the digital world.

## A list of goals:

- Research behaviours and attitudes to art; capture/map those attributes into an actual model
- Capture uniqueness of digital art
- Provide a canvas for the artist (development and promotion of online art)
- Register ownership
- Provide a means to store, distribute, "print" (not copy), transfer/trade and display art
- Create a community (with a decentralised voice)
- Promote (where required) a vocabularly for the space
- Provide a welcoming UI/UX environment; enusre cross-plaform as much as possible.

## Ideas for implementation:

- Use blockchain to capture uniqueness
- Use NFT (as with current models) to register ownership
-	Provide platform APIs
-	Build in payment Gateways (crypto and fiat)
-	Add blockscan facilities
- Website (initial realisation of platform).
